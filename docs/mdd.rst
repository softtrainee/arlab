MDD Modeling
=======================

This sections provides information on how to model a K-feldspar using Oscar Lovera's
Multiple Diffusion Domain modeling codes. Pychron provides an easy to use GUI to model and
visualize step heating and diffusion data. Currently Pychron simply wraps Lovera's 
fortran codes with a python GUI and does not do any MDD computations.
