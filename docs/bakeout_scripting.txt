Here's how to write a bakeoutscript

1. launch BakeoutManager (Bo on the dock) open the script editor (Edit scripts
button-  see attached screenshot) an empty script is opened as a default

2. use Open to open an existing script or just start writing one from scratch

3. write your script. see below

4. you may check the syntax of your script at any point by hitting Test. A
dialog will pop up saying if there was a problem and what it was or if the
script passed with no errors. The scripts syntax is also automatically checked
before saving.

5. Use save and save as in the normal manner. script files should end with .py
if the file ending is omitted a .py is appended automatically

6. close the script editor

here is an example script::

	#===========================================================================
	#this is a comment in the script. use it at your leisure 
	#the following line def main(): is required and the entry point for the script 
	def main(): 
		#this is the body of the main function 
		#it should be one tab in 
		ramp(150,100,start=45)
		setpoint(150,4) 
		ramp(0,-150) 
	#end of script
	#===========================================================================

Lets break it down line by line. A comment can be added anywhere using the #
character

def main(): defines a required function called "main" that will be executed when
the script is run. **The main  function is necessary** and is added to an empty
script by default.

the function ramp(150,100,start=45) sets the controller to 45 C, then increases
the temperature setting to 150C at a rate of 100 C/hr

the function setpoint(150,4) sets the controller to a temperature of 150 C and
holds it for 4 hours

ramp(0,-100) decreases the temperature setting from the current temperature to 0
C at a rate of -100 C/hr.

Notice that the **start** parameter of the **ramp** function is optional. If
omitted the controller's current temperature is used as the starting point
